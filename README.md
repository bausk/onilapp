### What Is This?

This is a companion app to my [Python deployment guide](https://github.com/bausk/guides/blob/master/python/01_start_and_deployment.md). Clone it if you want something to play with when making it through the tutorial.

### Is It Any Good?

Nah. This isn't production ready yet, so it can be frustrating. If you have any feedback or advice on where this should go, or can point to better examples that explain in detail how to start working with serverless platforms and Python/Dash/Flask.
